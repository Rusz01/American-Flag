<p>The task is to create an American flag. The flag is made with a combination of the ‘*’ star sign, ‘=’ equal sign, and empty spaces. It has 15 rows. Since, the rows and columns of the flags are known, I implemented the program by using for loops. Also, I applied ‘for loop’ to prevent repetition of code.</p>
